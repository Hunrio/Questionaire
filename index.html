			<p>Scoring your questionnaire:<br>
				To determine your style as a parent, first transfer your score for each item to the blanks beside the
				following item numbers listed in parentheses. (Put your score for item #2 in the first blank, item #4 in
				the second blank, and so on.) Then add your scores in each row across, and put the sum in the last
				blank.</p>
							<p>Autocratic belief score: <br>
				(2) ____ + (4) ____ + (8) ____ + (12) ____ + (13) ____ = ________<br>
				Permissive belief score:<br>
				(1) ____ + (5) ____ + (7) ____ + (11) ____ + (15) ____ = ________<br>
				Active* belief score:<br>
				(3) ____ + (6) ____ + (9) ____ + (10) ____ + (14) ____ = ________<br>
				Autocratic action score:<br>
				(17) ____ + (19) ____ + (22) ____ + (24) ____ + (28) ____ = ________<br>
				Permissive action score:<br>
				(16) ____ + (20) ____ + (23) ____ + (25) ____ + (29) ____ = ________<br>
				Active* action score:<br>
				(18) ____ + (21) ____ + (26) ____ + (27) ____ + (30) ____ = ________<br><br>

				To get a clearer look at how your scores on the three styles compare, transfer each of the six totals to 
				the appropriate blank in the table below. To get your combined scores, add your belief score and your
				action score for each of the three styles. Put these numbers in the blanks in the “Combined” column.
				Belief Action Combined <br><br>
				Autocratic _______ + _______ = _______<br>
				Permissive _______ + _______ = _______<br>
				Active* _______ + _______ = _______<br><br>
				Interpreting your scores:<br>
				The highest combined score possible for each style is 50. The higher your score, the more you tend
				toward the style of parenting. Your highest combined score, therefore, suggests the style of parenting
				you are currently using. If either of the other combined scores is within fifteen points of your highest
				score, consider your use of the two styles about equal. The greater the difference among scores, the
				greater your current preference for the style with the highest score.<br>
				Differences of more than fifteen points between belief scores and action scores for any style suggest
				that you tend to believe one thing, but do another. Do not be alarmed by this. It is common and
				understandable.<br><br>
				High Autocratic Score - If you’re like most people, you’ll find yourself more autocratic than you thought
				you were. But after all, this was the predominant style parents used when you were growing up. If
				you scored highest on this style, you probably find yourself in frequent battles with your child. Anger
				and frustration probably characterize the power struggles that you and your child experience. You are
				probably reading this web page to find some relief, as well as a more successful approach.<br><br>
				High Permissive Score - In an attempt to avoid being autocratic, you may have overcompensated and
				developed a permissive style. If you are in this group, your relationship with your child may be pretty
				good as long as you do what your child wants. But you probably find that your child gets very hostile,
				and perhaps even throws tantrums, when you do say no or make a demand of him or her. Your
				relationship is characterized by service and pleasing, but only in one direction. You may have already
				begun to resent this unfairness. If so, you probably scored higher on the autocratic scale than you
				expected. It is easy to get fed up with a permissive approach and flip back to an autocratic one.<br><br>
				High Active Score - If you scored highest on the active style, your relationship with your child is
				probably already positive. Though problems certainly occur, an atmosphere of mutual respect, trust,
				and teamwork enables you to handle them without the hurt or resentment that characterize the
				other styles. You are probably using many of the methods advocated and taught in Active Parenting
				courses at this website. Our goal is to support your efforts and help you discover other compatible
				techniques.<br><br>
				* The Active style is sometimes called the “Authoritative” or “Democratic” style.
